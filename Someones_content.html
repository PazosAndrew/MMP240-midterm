  The Brooklyn Bridge is one of the most iconic monuments not only in New York but in the world. The Brooklyn bridge has been connecting Manhattan and Brooklyn together since 1883. The bridge took over 12 years to complete, cost over $13 million and over 600 people worked on the bridge. It was designed by John A. Roebling who was an immigrant from Prussia. Over 5,000 people cross the bridge on a daily basis. It has been designated as a National Historic Landmark by the National Park Service and designated as a New York city Landmark by the Landmarks Preservative Commission. The bridge spans nearly 1600 feet across the East River and remains one of New York city’s most recognized symbols.
  	Upon the completion of the Brooklyn Bridge, it cost 1 penny to walk across and even went up to 5 pennies. Luckily that fee was waived, and you no longer have to pay to access the bridge. You can walk across the bridge which is only 1 mile long, 24 hours a day, completely free of charge. Also, there is no toll fee for driving on the Brooklyn Bridge. As one of New York City’s most iconic attractions it is highly encouraged for all who can to experience it and take advantage of the amazing views that it gives access to such as The Statue of Liberty! That’s right, you can see the beautiful Statue of Liberty from the Brooklyn Bridge. It is important to note that there are two paths and the one on the right is for pedestrians and the path on the left is for bicycles. The Brooklyn Bridge can be accessed from Brooklyn and Manhattan, see information below on how to get there.
