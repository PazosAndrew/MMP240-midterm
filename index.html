      <p> New York City as we know is a very large place with many landmarks and iconic locations that people love to come and see. In its five boroughs  you have an endless amount of museums, attractions, specialty shops, memorabilia and more. If you're unsure of where to start, or perhaps in the mood for something out of the ordinary then I invite you to continue reading on! We'll explore some of the locations that will blow you away, entertain you, or perhaps  even frighten you.

      <p>New York Harbor is a view many people find to be iconic and memorable. There's Ellis Island, the Statue of Liberty, and New York City's many many Bridges. One of which we'll be discussing is the Brooklyn Bridge.</P></figure>

          <p> While it would be really awesome to visit some of the lesser known museums, I highly encourage anyone to go visit as many museums as possible. A world of knowledge and art
            is at your fingertips, so go take a trip to the Museum of Modern Art, and the American Museum of Natural History. Once you've seen their exhibits, make sure to pay a visit to the lesser known museums too! </p> </figure>
