      <p>Have you ever been hungry and ordered the nearest takeout chinese food, or purchased something from a nearby halal stand and wondered to yourself " Hmm I wonder what other kinds of foods that culture has to offer?" Well the Museum of Food and Drink aims to do exactly that. With the purpose to educate people on the multiple facets of food. Some of these are how food is distributed, production of food, and Culinary history.

      <p> Lastly there's the Merchant's House Museum. The Museum was a house that belonged to the Tredwell family where they lived for nearly a century.It is also called Manhattan's first Landmark. Alot of paranormal activity has been reported by the people that visit or pass by. Now you can take a monthly ghost tour on the 13th of each month! Although recently a new housing development next door is threatening this iconic but somewhat unknown location. </p></figure>
